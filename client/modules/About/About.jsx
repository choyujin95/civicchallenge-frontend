          <p>D4SD is collaborating with the Design Forward Alliance to host a 2017 large-scale human-centered
          design challenge around the complex civic issue of Mobility. People need to move around a city.
          Whether for work or play—and by car, bike, train, bus, boat, or foot— mobility significant
          affects the daily lives of millions. San Diego is culturally and economically diverse,
          as well as geographical dispersed, which makes it a ripe topic for exploring issues around
          transportation. The mobility challenges below investigate concerns currently facing San Diegans,
          as well as take a look to future transportation systems.
